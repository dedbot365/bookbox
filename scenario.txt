SCENARIO 
A private book library store aims to expand its reach by retailing books online. The 
system will offer a catalog of books that users can browse and purchase. Users will be 
able to filter the catalog by criteria such as author, genre, availability (stock and physical 
library access), price range, ratings, language, and format (e.g., paperback, hardcover, 
exclusive editions like signed, limited, first, collector’s, author’s, deluxe, etc.). Additional 
filters include publishers, and users can search for books by title, ISBN, or description. 
Sorting options will allow users to organize books by title, publication date, price, or 
popularity (most sold). 
The platform will feature tabs for categories like All Books, Bestsellers, Award Winners, 
New Releases (published in the past three months), New Arrivals (listed in the past 
month), Coming Soon, and Deals (discounts and sales). 
Registered users, referred to as members, can bookmark books (whitelist) and view 
availability status, add books to their cart, and place cancelable orders. Currently, the 
store only offers in-store pickup. After placing an order, members will receive a 
confirmation email with a claim code and the bill. To complete the purchase, members 
must present their membership ID and claim code at the store, where staff will process 
the order through their portal. 
The system also includes a discount mechanism: an order of five or more books receives 
a 5% discount, and after every 10 successful orders, the member earns a 10% stackable 
discount on their next order. 
After purchasing, members can leave reviews as ratings and comments on books. 
Administrators have full control over the catalog, including the ability to create, update, 
and delete books and manage inventory. They can also add discounts to individual 
books, optionally flagging them as "On Sale" and setting discount periods. Admins can 
create timed announcements for deals, new arrivals, or other informational messages.
